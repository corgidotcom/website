hi, i'm corgi.
my interests are coding (exclusively web design atm), music (listen to quinn), and biking (i'm currently building my own bike).
i'm currently in school, so I don't have much time to code on my own.
if you have any suggestions for my website, feel free to submit an issue or create a pull request.
thank you for reading :)
